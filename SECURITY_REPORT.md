# Security Test Results

`run_security_tests.sh` was executed to perform static analysis and dynamic scans.

- **Bandit**: not installed in the environment; no Python security analysis was run.
- **OWASP ZAP**: not installed; no baseline scan was performed.
- **Lighthouse**: command not available; no audit report generated.

These tools should be installed and the script re-run in a full environment to produce complete reports.
